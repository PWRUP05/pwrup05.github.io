		<h1 style="font-size:230%">About me</h1>
		<p style="font-family:sans; font-size:140%">I've always struggled in writing about mes. I spend ages pondering over what to include and what not to. So, to keep things simple for me and the reader, I've written about some things I really like or deeply care about.</p>
		<p style="font-family:sans; font-size:140%"><b>Cars (any mechanised vehicle, actually). </b>I simply can't get enough of them, period. A lifelong dream I had - being able to drive - was realised in 2024, when I passed my driving test. I would love to own a manual Porsche someday. I think they embody the perfect blend of art and engineering.</p>
		<p style="font-family:sans; font-size:140%"><b>Computers. </b>I didn't have any particular interest in computers until my last year of secondary school, when I installed Linux on my ageing Core 2 Duo laptop. That really piqued my interest in computers and electronics and I'm even pursuing a degree in the latter.</p>
		<p style="font-family:sans; font-size:140%"><b>Simple design. </b>I was blown away by how a simple system like Linux can power a full-blown operating system which can do just about everything Windows can. Its simplicity makes it trivial to find the root cause of any problem encountered. Since then, I've always appreciated simple designs which get out of the user's way and just get the job done without any faff.</p>
		<p style="font-family:sans; font-size:140%"><b>Privacy. </b>I care deeply about my privacy, both online and offline, and have taken several steps to protect it at least to an extent. Of course, it's becoming increasingly harder to do so, with corpos and governments dead set on siphoning off user (and non-user) data for fattening up already fat profit margins and crushing dissent. And yet, it is for this exact reason we need to fight back for our rights.</p>
		<p> style="font-family:sans; font-size:140%"<b>Athletics. </b>I was never really that into team sports like football and cricket. Sure, I did enjoy while playing them, but didn't really get that, <i>I daresay,</i> fanaticism about them in me. Towards the end of 9th standard, I started running after I realised I needed to do <i>something</i> in order to keep myself in shape. And I loved it! From that time onward for the next two years, I ran around my building at least four times a week. Unfortunately, with JEE just a year away in my 12th, I stopped being regular with my runs. I have tried restarting running in college, but couldn't keep up with the same frequency as before. I started swimming in my second semester  </p>
